<h2>Delegating Permissions</h2>

<p>There are 2 ways for an embedder to delegate permission grants to an embedee: A
declarative syntax in the HTML tag that instantiates the embedee; and an
imperative syntax that extends the Permissions API. The imperative form also
offers a way for embedders to query for delegated permission grants to embedees,
and a way for embedders to undelegate permissions from embedees.</p>

<p>In both forms of the API, the caller needs names to refer to the permissions
that the Open Web Platform provides. These names come from the <a
href="https://w3c.github.io/permissions/#permission-registry">the Permissions
API Registry</a>.</p>

<p>In both forms of the API, both embedder and embedee must be qualified to
receive the permission grant, and the user agent must actually grant the
permission to the embedder (for example by prompting the user to grant the
permission). How individual UAs implement this varies.</p>

<p>Note that potentially this gives embedders more privilege than may be
strictly necessary; see <a href="#least-privilege">Breaks Principle Of Least
Privilege</a>. It also means that embedders have an incentive to police their
embedees, because bad behavior (such as abusing granted permissions) on the part
of embedees is likely to reflect on embedders.</p>

<h3>Declarative API</h3>

<p>For example, consider an embedder https://restaurant.example.net whose
developers want to show a map on the page that enables people to get directions
to the restaurant. They can do so by instantiating an iframe to the maps service
https://maps.example.com, and by explicitly delegating the
<var>geolocation</var> permission:

<pre>
&lt;iframe id="embedee" src="https://maps.example.com/"
permissions="geolocation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that both embedder and embedee must meet the minimum security bar to
even ask for <var>geolocation</var> permission in the first place. Currently,
the minimum bar is that both sites must be i<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/powerful-features/">secure contexts</a>.</p>

<p>Consider next that the developers of https://restaurant.example.net learn of
a new feature that https://maps.example.com provides, which is to send people
push notifications when it’s time to leave to get to their destination on time.
(For example, people may want to know not just the directions to the restaurant,
but also to be notified when they should leave to make it by the time their
reservation starts.) The developers would explicitly grant the embedded iframe a
second permission, <var>notifications</var>:</p>

<pre>
&lt;iframe id="embedee" src="https://maps.example.com/" permissions="geolocation
notifications"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Imperative API</h3>

<h4>Delegating Permissions To Embedees</h4>

<p>TODO: Consider <code>grant</code> and <code>revoke</code> rather than
<code>delegate</code> and <code>undelegate</code>.</p>

<pre>
var embedee = document.getElementById('embedee')
try {
  navigator.permissions.delegate(embedee, 'geolocation')
  navigator.permissions.delegate(embedee, 'notifications')
  navigator.permissions.delegate(embedee, 'midi')
} catch (securityException) {
  console.log(securityException)
}
</pre>

<h4>Querying The Status Of An Embedee’s Permissions</h4>

<pre>
var embedee = document.getElementById('embedee')
navigator.permissions.query({name: 'geolocation', frame: embedee})
  .then(function(result) {
    // result === 'granted'
  });
</pre>

<h4>Handling Events When Embedees Ask For Permission</h4>

<pre>
var embedee = document.getElementById('embedee')
embedee.addEventListener('requestPermissionGeolocation', function (e) {
  // ...
})
</pre>

<p>These events will fire whenever the embedee requests to use the permission,
whether or not the embedder has granted it.</p>

<pre>
var embedee = document.getElementById('embedee')
embedee.addEventListener('queryPermissionGeolocation', function (e) {
  // ...
})
</pre>

<p>These events will fire whenever the embedee invokes
<code>navigator.permissions.query</a> for the permission, whether or not the
embedder has granted it.</p>

<h4>Un-Delegating Permissions</h4>

<pre>
var embedee = document.getElementById('embedee')
navigator.permissions.undelegate(embedee, 'geolocation')
</pre>

<h2>Threat Models And Risks</h2>

<p>TODO</p>

<h2>Security Considerations</h2>

<a name="least-privilege"></a>
<h3>Breaks Principle Of Least Privilege</h3>

<p>The obvious downside of this proposal is that an iframe can’t get access to a
permission without the top level frame also getting access to the permission.
For example, currently when purchasing an airline ticket on the British Airways
website with an AMEX credit card, an iframe navigated to the AMEX site may ask
for your location in order to verify your purchase. Under this proposal, the
user would have to give access to their location to British Airways as well as
AMEX instead of just AMEX. Note that the decision would only be persisted for
British Airways.</p>

<p>We could extend this scenario to a potentially more problematic case where a
less trustworthy site, such as https://suspicious.com also allows purchases and
embeds an AMEX frame for credit card verification. Now the user has to give
access to their location to https://suspicious.com as well as AMEX to complete
their purchase which obviously is not ideal. </p>

<p>On the flip side, in the current situation where iframes are allowed to request
location directly, https://suspicious.com can pretend to embed AMEX and try to
phish the user’s location access (note that there may be other ways to mitigate
this risk as well).</p>

<h3>Breaks Legacy Applications</h3>

<p>Web apps that currently utilise iframes that request permissions will be
broken by this proposal. In order to restore functionality, website owners will
need to change their &lt;iframe&gt; tags to specify which permissions they wish
to delegate. We have given more detail about the nature of this breakage in the
section below on compatibility risk. In particular the usage of permission
features in iframes is already very low on the web, meaning the impact should be
small.</p>

<p>The upside of this breakage is that any harmful/annoying permission requests
from third party iframes, which website owners did not intend their users to be
exposed to will be prevented.</p>

<p>Furthermore, this proposal would cause secure (HTTPS) iframes embedded in
non-secure (HTTP) sites to no longer be capable of getting access to
permissions. The reason is that the availability of “powerful features” on
non-secure origins is being phased out (see the Secure Contexts spec). This
means that a top level HTTP site would never be able to access a permission in
order to delegate it. This is actually not more restrictive than what is
specified in the Secure Contexts spec, which requires all ancestor frames be
secure in order for a frame to be considered secure (see the section on
Ancestral Risk). So this proposal would not result in additional breakages
compared with what is planned to be implemented in that specification.</p>

<h3>Changing iframe Permissions</h3>

<p>Another, longer-term downside is that it is hard to change permissions on
&lt;iframe&gt; tags that have already been deployed. This is made worse by the
fact that iframes tend to be fairly widely copy/pasted. For example, to make it
easy for developers to embed YouTube videos, YouTube provides a HTML
&lt;iframe&gt; snippet which can be pasted into a website. If the permissions
required to run YouTube ever changed, it would be impossible for YouTube to
update all the users. In some ways this could be considered a good thing, as
first party website owners would explicitly have to decide whether to allow an
iframe to get access to a permission.</p>
