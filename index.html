<p>Fortunately we already have some keywords defined in the Permissions API spec:

API Registry</a>.</p>

iframe Permission Scoping in Chrome</a></p>

<p>There are 2 ways for an embedder to delegate permission grants to an embedee: A
declarative syntax in the HTML tag that instantiates the embedee; and an
imperative syntax that extends the Permissions API. The imperative form also
offers a way for embedders to query for delegated permission grants to embedees,
and a way for embedders to undelegate permissions from embedees.</p>

<h2>Delegating Permissions</h2>

<h3>Declarative API</h3>

<p>For example, consider an embedder https://restaurant.example.net whose
developers want to show a map on the page that enables people to get directions
to the restaurant. They can do so by instantiating an iframe to the maps service
https://maps.example.com, and by explicitly delegating the
<var>geolocation</var> permission:

<pre>
&lt;iframe id="embedee" src="https://maps.example.com/"
permissions="geolocation"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

<p>Note that both embedder and embedee must meet the minimum security bar to
even ask for <var>geolocation</var> permission in the first place. Currently,
the minimum bar is that both sites must be i<a
href="http://www.w3.org/TR/powerful-features/">secure contexts</a>.</p>

<p>Consider next that the developers of https://restaurant.example.net learn of
a new feature that https://maps.example.com provides, which is to send people
push notifications when itâ€™s time to leave to get to their destination on time.
(For example, people may want to know not just the directions to the restaurant,
but also to be notified when they should leave to make it by the time their
reservation starts.) The developers would explicitly grant the embedded iframe a
second permission, <var>notifications</var>:</p>

<pre>
&lt;iframe id="embedee" src="https://maps.example.com/" permissions="geolocation
notifications"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;
</pre>

<h3>Imperative API</h3>

<pre>
var embedee = document.getElementById('embedee')
try {
  navigator.permissions.delegate(embedee, 'geolocation')
  navigator.permissions.delegate(embedee, 'notifications')
  navigator.permissions.delegate(embedee, 'midi')
} catch (securityException) {
  console.log(securityException)
}
</pre>

<pre>
navigator.permissions.query({name: 'geolocation', frame: embedee})
  .then(function(result) {
    // result === 'granted'
  });
</pre>

<pre>
navigator.permissions.undelegate(embedee, 'geolocation')
</pre>
